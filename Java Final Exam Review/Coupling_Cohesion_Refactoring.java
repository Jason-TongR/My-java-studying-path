     * 1.Coupling:
     *      *coupling refers to links between separete units of a program.
     *      *if two classes depend closely on many details of each other,we say they are tightly coupled.
     *      *we aim for loose coupling
     * 
     * 
     * 2.cohesion:
     *      *cohesion refers to the number and diversity of tasks that a single unit is responsible for.
     *      *if each logical task,we say it has high cohesion
     *      *cohension applies to classes and methods
     *      *we aim for high cohesion
     *      
     *  
     * 3.Refactoring:
     *      *when classes are maintained,often code is added.
     *      *classes and methods tend to become longer
     *      *every now and then,classes and methods should be refactored to maintain clhesion and low coupling.
